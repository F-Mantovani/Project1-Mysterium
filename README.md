# Project - Module 1
### IronHack WebDevelopment Bootcamp

This project was to make a game using the features learned in the Module 1, like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I've choosen to make a iteration for one of my favorite board games: Mysterium.

This iteration is a hotseat style. So the players need to take turns in front of the screen.

One player is the Ghost, that player got murdered and is trying to make the other player, the Medium, to discover who killed him, where it took place and with what weapon. 
To accomplish that, the Ghost must pass vision to the Medium hoping this will sufice for the Medium unravel the mystery.
